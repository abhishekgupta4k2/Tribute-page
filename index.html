            <h3>About</h3>
            Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born
            theoretical physicist, widely ranked among the greatest and most
            influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the
            theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum
            mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary
            reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern
            physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth
            century. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which
            arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most
            famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the
            philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in
            Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for
            his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal
            step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual
            achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming
            synonymous with "genius". Einsteinium, one of the synthetic
            elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.

            <h3>Work</h3>
            If metal electrodes are exposed to light, electrical sparks between them occur
            more readily. For this photoelectric effect to occur, the light waves must be
            above a certain frequency, however. According to physics theory, the light's
            intensity should be critical. In one of several epoch-making studies beginning in 1905,
            Albert Einstein explained that light consists of quanta—packets with fixed energies
            corresponding to certain frequencies. One such light quantum, a photon, must have a
            certain minimum frequency before it can liberate an electron.
